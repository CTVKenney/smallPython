A couple possibilities for approximating a Poisson distribution with parameter lambda:
We could write a loop which exits as soon as it chooses a value for the random variable,
running through the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and flipping a biased coin at each step to decide
whether to choose the current number as its output.
